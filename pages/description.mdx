<ExternalLink href="https://shroomkingdom.net/">Shroom Kingdom</ExternalLink> is
an upcoming video game, which will be similar to Mario Maker, but it runs in your
browser. It uses existing assets of the game, which have been reverse engineered
and will be extracted, so that they can easily be loaded in the browser. The game
is still very WIP, but I'm doing good progress.

Here you can see the asset extraction process, which uses an external program available for all desktop platforms.
It decrypts a so called XCI file, which is one of the file formats for Nintendo Switch games,
and then parses and rebundles the resulting asset file into a TAR file with extracted textures in PNG format.

Here is a short demonstration of some early footage of the game:

What's special about the game is that there is an integration with a blockchain called <ExternalLink href="https://near.org/">NEAR Protocol</ExternalLink>.
NEAR Protocol is a climate neutral Proof of Stake blockchain,
which allows running WebAssembly Smart Contracts (it's like a programmable decentralized database).
Since many people are extremely new to blockchain gaming, I'd like to give away some NEAR tokens for free.
You have to complete the following tasks in order to get your link.
This link can be used to create a web-based wallet on the NEAR Protocol blockchain.
You will receive 0.1 NEAR with the link, which is ~0.8$.
By using such a link, you can avoid creating an account on a centralized exchange like <ExternalLink href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</ExternalLink> and go through their KYC (Know Your Customer) process.
