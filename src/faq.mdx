- Are you serious? Isn't this free money? This sounds super scammy.

_Yes, I'm serious. Yes, this is free money (~0.8$)._

_They have been specializing in bootstrapping gaming projects on NEAR Protocol and I have been one of the first projects to get a grant._
_I want to reach out to people new to blockchain gaming and help onboarding them._

- Can we already play the game?

- What about the link? How are they generated? Can I get more than one?

_You can only get one link per person. The link is generated via a project called <ExternalLink href="https://neardrop.io/">NEARDrop</ExternalLink>_

- Why did you decide to build a blockchain game?

_Blockchain gaming is a very new topic, but it's emerging right now._
_There have been very succesfull blockchain games like <ExternalLink href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</ExternalLink>_
_, which use a mechanism called <ExternalLink href="https://www.playtoearn.online/whats-the-play-to-earn-business-model/">play to earn</ExternalLink>._
_To explain it briefly, play to earn rewards players by giving them tokens, which are stored on the blockchain._
_The game can do that, because a token is basically just a value stored on the blockchain._
_A Smart Contract would be called that can alter the state on the chain and generate tokens for a specific wallet address._
_The user who owns that wallet can then swap his tokens for other cryptocurrencies or he can move them to a centralized exchange and sell them for real money._

_Simply put, play to earn connects an in-game economy to the real world economy._
_The concept fascinated my this much, that I decided to launch my own blockchain gaming project._

_Yes, we launched a token called SHRM and you can earn it by playing or building levels (not yet, because we're not live)._
